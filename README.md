# Sarahpin!

A Pinbot for discord servers.

## Running:

```bash
yarn add # or npm i
yarn start # or npm run start
```

## Note:

References to private/ in the code is for secrets I can't push such as the bot API token.

They (should) be hopefully commented with what to substitute, or you can run 

```bash
mkdir private
``` 

in the root directory and see the (not yet written) docs for what files to put where.
